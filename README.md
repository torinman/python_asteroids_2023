# python_asteroids_2023

A rewriting of my 2020-2021 python recreation of the arcade game Asteroids, using better code practices and the experience I have gained over the past 2 and a half years since I made the original. Like the original, it uses Python 3, and Pygame.

# Why I am making this

I am making this primarily because I am going to make a multiplayer version of Asteroids. In doing so, I have noticed that the original code is extremely repetetive, confusing, and unoptimised. this version is going to be much more pythonic, readable, optimized, and reuseable
