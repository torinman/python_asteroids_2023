# python_asteroids_2023

A rewriting of my 2020-2021 python recreation of the arcade game Asteroids, using better code practices and the experience I have gained over the past 2 and a half years since I made the original.

I've never actually played the original game, so have based this on youtube videos and talking to people who have played it

Game keys used are either Q for thrust, A for shoot and OP for rotation; or Up for Thrust, Space for shoot and Left and Right for Rotate. H for hyperspace jump

The program requires PyGame and Python 3

Sound files all created by Torin Stephens

Tested and developed under PyGame 2.1.2 and Python 3.8.5

# Why I am making this

I am making this primarily because I am going to make a multiplayer version of Asteroids. In doing so, I have noticed that the original code is extremely repetetive, confusing, and unoptimised. this version is going to be much more pythonic, readable, optimized, and reuseable
